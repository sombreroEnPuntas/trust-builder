## Intro

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
After ejecting, I added the required font-family and a sass loader for webpack.

I decided to go for `React.js` because it is one of the major frameworks currently used.
This way, the widget could be easily delivered to partners as a dependency for their projects.

Tradeoff: yes, it does not work if you are not using react ;)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
